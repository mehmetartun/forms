# Forms in Flutter

This project is a tutorial on Flutter Forms together with best practices 
for editing objects, creating custom `FormField` widgets and expooring 
some of the things to pay attention to when dealing with forms.

## Tag 1.0.0
We start with a blank project created using
```zsh
flutter create . --org com.artun
```
and we remove the counter and floating action button to have an empty page in the start.
